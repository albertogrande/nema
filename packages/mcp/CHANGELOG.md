## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 178d8a9: Coherence: a propose-time pre-check and rename-aware diagnostics.

  - **Pre-flight at propose time.** `nema open-pr` and the `propose_changes` MCP tool now run a
    best-effort coherence pre-check first: if another open `nema/draft/*` branch is already authoring
    a page you changed, they print a non-blocking warning (with the colliding page) so the
    `slot-collision` is caught _before_ the PR rather than at merge. Single-agent repos (no other
    draft branches) are unaffected and pay no cost. New export: `precheckProposeCoherence` in
    `@getnema/producer`.
  - **Rename-aware merge diagnostics.** When one branch _moves_ a page (delete old route + add the
    same content at a new route) and another branch still links the old route, the `merge-coherence`
    error now reads `… '/old' was renamed to '/new' on <branch>; update the link` instead of a bare
    dead link. `mergeCorpora` returns the detected `renames`.

### Minor Changes

- f013a04: Add merge-time coherence — the second half of the multi-agent moat.

  Page-level slot leasing stops two _live_ agents clobbering the _same_ page; this closes the
  remaining gap — two _draft branches_ that each pass `nema check` alone but break the corpus when
  merged together.

  - `@getnema/gates` ships `runCoherenceGate(corpora, { base })`: it 3-way merges the contributing
    corpora against a baseline (a real line-level `diff3`, so independent edits to a shared page —
    e.g. two agents each adding a nav link — merge cleanly the way git would) and validates the
    _merged_ doc-graph. It reports `slot-collision` (a page authored on two branches incompatibly)
    and `merge-coherence` (a link or page one branch breaks for another). Both have `nema explain`
    entries.
  - `@getnema/producer` adds corpus loaders: `loadCorpusFromDir`, `loadCorpusAtRef` (via an ephemeral
    `git worktree`, so the live tree is untouched), and `listDraftBranches` to discover the open
    `nema/draft/*` refs that would merge into `main`.
  - `@getnema/cli` adds `nema coherence` — auto-discovers the open draft branches and checks their
    merge into `main`, or takes explicit directories / git refs (`--base`, `--json`).
  - `@getnema/mcp` exposes the `check_coherence` tool so an agent can verify a fleet's branches merge
    cleanly before requesting review.

  `pnpm demo:concurrent` drives the whole moat — leasing + coherence — end to end and is exercised in
  CI.

- 2027945: Add multi-agent concurrent authoring — page-level slot leasing.

  Branch isolation already lets agents author _different_ pages without clobbering (each
  `propose_changes` lands on its own branch). The remaining clobber — two agents writing the
  _same_ page at once — is now prevented by a lease:

  - `@getnema/producer` ships the lease primitive (`acquireLease`/`releaseLease`/`readLease`):
    a tracked file under `.nema/leases/<path>.lease`, acquired with an atomic `O_EXCL` create
    so racing agents resolve to one winner with no coordination server. Leases expire (a dead
    agent never strands a page).
  - `@getnema/mcp` exposes `claim_slot` / `release_slot` tools and adds an optional `agent` id
    to `draft_page` / `update_page`; when set, a write to a page another agent holds is refused.
    The single-agent path stays lease-free and backward-compatible.
  - `@getnema/cli` adds `nema claim <path> --agent <id>` and `nema release <path> --agent <id>`
    for a two-terminal demonstration of the moat.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- b12c39b: Phase 0 day-1 experience: `create-nema --app` scaffolds a rendering Fumadocs app (Next.js) on the
  published packages, so a stranger goes `npx create-nema my-docs --app` → `npm install` → `npm run dev`
  → a badged, rendered page with no source build. The MCP registration hint now uses
  `npx -y @getnema/cli` (the package that actually publishes). The MCP `draft_page` tool rejects an empty
  body, matching the CLI guard, so the write-path behaves identically across CLI and MCP.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f4fd409: Make `nema check` actionable and machine-readable — for humans and agents.

  Gate failures are now teaching moments. A new rule catalog (`RULE_CATALOG` in `@getnema/gates`) is
  the single source of truth for every gate's title, one-line fix hint, and long-form explanation.
  `runGates` enriches each `Diagnostic` with its `hint`, and the text report renders it as a
  rustc/cargo-style `help:` line plus a "run `nema explain <rule>`" footer.

  - **`nema check --json`** emits a stable, machine-readable report (`gateReport()` / `GateReportJson`):
    `{ ok, checked, errorCount, warningCount, diagnostics: [{ rule, severity, path, message, hint }] }`
    — for CI tooling and agents.
  - **`nema explain <rule>`** prints what a gate checks and how to fix it (à la `rustc --explain`),
    suggests the closest rule on a typo, and lists every rule when given no argument.
  - **`nema doctor`** preflights the environment and repo (Node, git, gh + auth, config, content
    directory, gate summary) with a fix hint on every non-green check.
  - **MCP `check` and `draft_page`** now return MCP `structuredContent` (the same diagnostics and
    fix hints) alongside the text, so an agent can act on the exact rule/path/hint instead of parsing
    prose.
  - **`nema check` no longer reports a false green** on a missing or empty content directory — it
    surfaces an `empty-corpus` warning and always prints the number of pages checked.
  - Fixed a stale-brand string in the MCP draft feedback ("forge check" → "nema check").

  `Diagnostic` gains an optional `hint`; `GateResult` gains `checked` (the number of pages scanned).

- 8f3fc5f: Serve the MCP read tools over Streamable HTTP. Adds `createReadOnlyNemaMcpServer` (only the
  corpus read tools — list_pages / get_page / get_provenance / search / check, with no write or git
  surface) and `startHttpServer`, plus `nema mcp --http [--read-only] [--port]` and the
  `NEMA_MCP_PORT` / `NEMA_MCP_READONLY` env switches on the `nema-mcp` bin. A hosted read-only
  endpoint lets remote agents query a published corpus and its provenance without any ability to
  mutate it.
- 84ddb1c: Add optional bearer-token auth to the Streamable HTTP MCP server. When `startHttpServer` is given an
  `authToken` (the `nema mcp --http` command reads it from `$NEMA_MCP_TOKEN`, configurable with
  `--auth-token-env`), every HTTP request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the token is
  SHA-256 hashed at startup and compared in constant time (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`). `/health` stays
  open, and stdio / dev / intentionally-public modes are unaffected. When no token is set the server
  prints a one-line stderr warning that the corpus is served unauthenticated. This is defense-in-depth
  for exposing a private, provenance-bearing corpus to remote agents — not a substitute for a gateway on
  a hostile network.
- 8f3fc5f: Surface provenance on the consumption surfaces.

  Adds `provenanceView()` / `provenanceHeaders()` (and the `ProvenanceView` type) to core: a flat,
  machine-readable view of a page's trust metadata (authored_by, model, reviewer, status, freshness).
  The docs `.md` route now returns ASCII-safe `X-Nema-*` provenance headers plus a `Link: …?meta`
  pointer, and an opt-in `?meta` (or `Accept: application/json`) variant returns the full structured
  record — all without changing the Markdown body, so `.md`/`get_page` parity holds. The MCP server
  gains a `get_provenance` tool that returns the same view, kept separate from `get_page` so the prose
  stays byte-identical.

- 77aa159: Rebrand `docforge` → **Nema**.

  The npm scope becomes `@getnema/*`, the CLI binary becomes `nema` (e.g. `nema check`,
  `nema draft`, `nema approve`), the MCP binary becomes `nema-mcp`, and the config file is
  now `nema.config.{ts,js,mjs,json}`. The commit-trailer key is `Nema-Provenance`, the draft
  PR label is `nema:draft`, and the `FORGE_ROOT` env var is now `NEMA_ROOT`. Internal types
  `ForgeConfig`/`ForgeHost`/`ForgeTools`/`ForgeMcpServer` are renamed to the `Nema*` prefix.

  No behavioral change — this is a pure rename. The enterprise license ref
  (`LicenseRef-Forge-EE-Placeholder`) and the live GitHub repo URLs are intentionally left
  untouched (they track the GitHub-side repo/org move, which is a separate manual step).

### Patch Changes

- 15c90b7: Finalize the package scope ahead of the first npm release. The engine and adapters now publish under
  the `@getnema/*` org scope, the CLI is the unscoped `nema` package (so `npx nema check ./docs`
  works), and the scaffolder is `create-nema` (so `npm create nema` works). The `@nema/*` names were
  always placeholders. No behavior change — package names, dependency references, and imports only.
